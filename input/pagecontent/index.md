### Introduction

This is the current version of the FHIR IG for **Diabetes 2 DMP (Disease Management Program) in Germany**. This project is in no way official.

A good entry point for browsing the Implementation Guide's resources is (at this time) the [DDG DMP Composition](StructureDefinition-ddg-dmp-composition.html) resource.
