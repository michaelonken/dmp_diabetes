# FHIR IG: Diabetes 2 DMP for Germany

This project aims at modelling the current version of Germany's DMP (Disease Management Program) documents for Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 in FHIR.

This project is in no way official.

Since this project is currently focused on Germany, most of the information is in German language for now (sorry).

**The whole project is work in progress.**
